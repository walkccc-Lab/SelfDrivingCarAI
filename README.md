# Self Driving Car AI

This is a project of Artificial Intelligence Self Driving Car.

## Getting Started

Please install both [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to start the project.

Here are the versions in my computer:

```
Kivy                               1.10.1.dev0
Kivy-Garden                        0.1.4
torch                              0.4.0      
torchvision                        0.2.1
Python 3.6.4 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)
```

## Running the App

Typing

```python
python map.py
```

in your command line to run the task.

## How to Play

After running the Kivy canvas, you can hold on your left-mouse button to draw the line, then the car will be learning the path by [Deep Q-Learning Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).
